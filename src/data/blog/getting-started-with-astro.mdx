Astro has quickly become one of my favourite frameworks for building content-driven websites. In this post, I'll walk through how I set up this very site.

## Why Astro?

Astro ships zero JavaScript by default. That means your pages load incredibly fast, and you only add interactivity where you need it — the "islands architecture" approach.

Some things I love about Astro:

- **Content Collections** — define schemas for your content and get type safety out of the box
- **MDX Support** — write in Markdown with embedded components when you need them
- **Framework Agnostic** — use React, Vue, Svelte, or nothing at all
- **Fast by Default** — no client-side JS unless you opt in

## Setting Up Content Collections

The content layer API in Astro 5 uses a `src/content.config.ts` file where you define your collections with a loader and a Zod schema. The `glob` loader picks up Markdown and MDX files from a directory, and the schema validates your frontmatter.

This gives you full type safety when querying posts in your Astro pages — no more guessing what fields are available.

## What's Next

In future posts I'll cover adding styling, deploying to GitHub Pages, and building interactive components with Astro islands. Stay tuned!
