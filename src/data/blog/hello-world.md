Welcome to my blog! This is the first post on my new site built with Astro. I've been meaning to start writing for a while now, and I'm excited to finally have a place to share my thoughts on web development, music, and everything in between.

I built this site using Astro because it's fast, flexible, and makes working with content a breeze. Markdown and MDX support means I can focus on writing without worrying about complex setups.

Stay tuned for more posts where I'll dive into topics like frontend development, creative coding, and maybe some DJ mix breakdowns. Thanks for stopping by!
