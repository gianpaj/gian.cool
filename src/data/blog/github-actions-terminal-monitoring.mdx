When you're deep in the terminal or your IDE, switching to a browser just to check if a build passed is a context-switching killer.

One of the coolest "hidden" superpowers of terminal-based AI agents or harnesses like **Claude Code** is their ability to interact with your environment beyond just writing code. I recently started asking my terminal agent to **apply AI code review fixes** — all without leaving the shell.

## Checking `CI` Status with [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/)

Instead of refreshing a browser tab, I just ask Claude Code to check my runs. Under the hood, it uses the GitHub CLI. Here are the key commands:

### List recent runs

```bash
gh run list --limit 10
```

Shows the last 10 workflow runs across all branches. You get a table with status (`✓`, `✗`, `-` for in-progress), title, workflow name, branch, event trigger, run ID, elapsed time, and age. It's the quickest way to get a pulse on your CI.

### Filter by branch

```bash
gh run list --branch test/playwright-e2e-setup --limit 5
```

Narrows the results to a specific branch — useful when you're iterating on a feature branch and only care about those runs.

### Get structured JSON output

```bash
gh run list --branch test/playwright-e2e-setup --json status,conclusion,name,workflowName,databaseId,headBranch,event --limit 5
```

The `--json` flag lets you pick exactly which fields you want as structured data. This is what makes it powerful for AI agents — they can parse the JSON reliably and reason about the results without guessing from truncated table columns.

## Applying AI Code Review Fixes from the Terminal

I've been using another pattern: asking Claude Code to look at comments left by AI code review bots (like CodeRabbit) on my PRs and apply the valid suggestions automatically.

I set up an [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) snippet with the keyword `/revgh` that expands to:

```text
/look at the comments from ai code review agents in `{cursor}` using gh and apply those fixes ONLY if valid
```

Where `{cursor}` is where Alfred places my cursor so I can type the PR number or branch name. The agent then:

1. Fetches the PR review comments via `gh pr view` and `gh api`
2. Reads through the AI reviewer suggestions
3. Applies only the ones that are actually valid fixes (not just style nitpicks or false positives)

## Why This Matters

- **Zero context switching** — I stay in my IDE/terminal the entire time.
- **Instant analysis** — The agent doesn't just show a red ✗. It reads the logs and tells me *"The Playwright test failed because the auth state file wasn't found at the expected path."*
- **Proactive fixes** — It often follows up with: *"Want me to fix that?"*
- **Composable workflows** — Combining `gh` commands with AI agents turns simple CLI tools into powerful automation.

## Getting Started

All you need is the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated:

```bash
gh auth login
```

From there, any terminal-based AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) can use `gh` as a tool. Terminal agents are evolving from "code writers" to full-blown "environment operators" — and checking CI status is just the beginning.
