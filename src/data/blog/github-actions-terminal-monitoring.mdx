When you're deep in the terminal, switching to a browser just to check if a build passed is a context-switching killer. 

One of the coolest "hidden" superpowers of terminal-based AI agents like **Claude Code** (or even custom OpenClaw scripts) is their ability to interact with your environment beyond just writing code. 

I recently started asking my terminal agent to monitor my **GitHub Action statuses** directly.

## The Workflow

Instead of refreshing a browser tab, I can just type:
> "Check the status of the last few GitHub Action runs and tell me why they failed if they did."

The agent uses the GitHub CLI (`gh`) under the hood to fetch the data, parses the logs, and gives me a concise summary of exactly which step broke and why.

## Why This Matters

- **Zero Context Switching:** I stay in my IDE/Terminal.
- **Instant Analysis:** It doesn't just show a red "X"; it reads the logs and tells me "The linting failed because of a missing semicolon on line 42."
- **Proactive Fixes:** Often, the agent will immediately follow up with: "Would you like me to fix that linting error for you?"

## Setting it up

If you have the GitHub CLI installed and authenticated, agents like Claude Code can just use it. You can even create a simple shell alias or a custom tool in your assistant's config to trigger this:

```bash
gh run list --limit 5
```

Terminal agents are evolving from just "code writers" to full-blown "environment operators." Checking CI status is just the beginning.
