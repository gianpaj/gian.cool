I've been meaning to build this app, and I actually started around this time last year. But after learning how to "code" or build with AI coding agents like `claude` code, I just gave it this prompt:

> plan how to complete this app. it should allow one or multiple files to be selected or dragged (audio only) and then it should show a box to select which format to convert to e.g mp3, wav, aac,ogg, flac,m4a, mp4) plus certain options that come from ffmpeg to compress the file

It wrote this comprehensive [plan](https://gist.github.com/gianpaj/f722903768ebf39652e10e8e259d57bb). And the it went for it. I asked a small question to fix a small UI color issue. And voila!

A(I) built Audioslim, a native macOS app that converts audio between MP3, WAV, AAC, OGG, FLAC, M4A, and MP4. I built it with [claude code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), Anthropic's AI coding assistant for the terminal.

## The Stack

Audioslim uses:

- Tauri v2 with a Rust backend — fast, lightweight, and native
- React 18 + TypeScript for the UI
- ffmpeg (your system install) for audio processing

The app weighs under 5 MB. An Electron equivalent ships a full Chromium browser.

## What It Does

Drop audio files onto the window or pick them with a file chooser. Select your output format. Adjust compression settings: bitrate, sample rate, channels, and format-specific options
like MP3 VBR or FLAC compression level. Hit "Convert." Output files land next to the originals, and you see before/after file sizes in real time.

Supported formats: MP3, WAV, AAC, OGG, FLAC, M4A, and MP4 (audio-only).

## Building With Claude Code

Claude Code wrote the Rust backend, the React frontend, and the Tauri configuration. I described what I wanted in plain English — a drag-and-drop audio converter with configurable compression — and iterated from there.

The project took a fraction of the time I would have spent writing it by hand.

## Try It

Audioslim is free, open source, and available now for macOS (Apple Silicon):

- [Audioslim_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg](https://github.com/gianpaj/audioslim/releases/download/0.1.0/Audioslim_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg)

You need ffmpeg installed (`brew install ffmpeg` if you use Homebrew).
